<p>So I got a chance to play with Galatea by Emily Short, and was quickly reminded how much I love interactive fiction games. (Thanks to David Pflug for pointing me to it)</p>
<p>I decided to share with the class.</p>
<p>Interactive fiction games are like books or stories that you control. Think of them as text-based role playing games. They have lost popularity in recent years because people have flocked to games that do not require reading... and thinking. As a starter for those who want to dive in I present here the IF game that started it all. Zork.</p>
<p>Zork is a fantasy, a sci-fi, an adventure, a whatever you want it to be. This as the first real IF game and one of the best games of all time that I may spend the next year trying to complete. Source code has been released by infocom, and they have since disregarded copyrights, so I took the liberty of converting them into zblorb files playable in modern z-machine emulators.</p>
<p>Download -&gt; "zork1.zblorb(Zork 1)":/media/dump/zblorbs/zork1.zblorb | "zork1.zblorb(Zork 2)":/media/dump/zblorbs/zork2.zblorb | "zork3.zblorb(Zork 3)":/media/dump/zblorbs/zork3.zblorb</p>
<p>The game that got me hooked on IF again is Galatea by Emily Short, which is a full representation of a work of art that is alive, that you can converse with and end up with one of dozens of endings depending on how you treat her/it.</p>
<p>Download -&gt; "galatea.zblorb(Galatea)":/media/dump/zblorbs/galatea.zblorb</p>
<p>For *nix/mac users these can be played with nfrotz or gargoyle (a graphical player that runs on top of nfrotz) You can easily grab these with most Linux package managers.</p>
<p>For windows users... you might try Windows Nfrotz which is a windows compile of nfrotz, however I have not tested it and do not plan to.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
