    <h2>Email Security With GPG Keys</h2>
    <p class="entry-timeauthor">
      Posted on:

        <span>May</span>
        <span>2009</span>
      </time>
    </p>
    <p>When I was younger (and not quite as aware of consequences) I used to set up relay mail servers and send out perfectly spoofed mail from president@whitehouse.gov to people who made assumptions about security. My spoofs were perfect (other than the fact they did not originate from white-house IP address ranges and that the president never actually sends mail from that address). My method still easily fools Gmail spam filters and I can easily impersonate anyone I want.</p>
<p>Problem is so can thousands of other people... that will do so with worse intent than proving a point.</p>
<p>GPG to the rescue.</p>
<p>GPG is a free and Open Source implementation of the OpenPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption standard.</p>
<p>At a glance it seems complicated, but I will try to break it down. It works using a pair of "keys". One of them is "public" and you put it on the Internet for the world to access, and the other is private and password protected and used only to verify you are the one that created the public key, or to decrypt files that were encrypted using that public key.</p>
<p>In email, it helps verify you are who you say you are by taking the contents of the message you are about to send and then generates a one-of-a-kind string based on that message and your private key. Anyone with your public key should be able to use that "signature" to verify you had possession of the private key and that the message has not been altered in any way.</p>
<p>Google has finally stepped up to the plate and begun to utilize this in Gmail. Though Gmail can not yet send messages with PGP signatures yet, work is underway to allow you to at least verify them. (I verified this personally with my Gmail account though the functionality only lasted a few hours.) If someone sends you a message to your Gmail account with a PGP signature, Google will soon go find that persons public key and verify it for you. It will then place a "message was verified" message at the bottom of the email. Google finally acknowledging how important authenticity of email.</p>
<p>Once this becomes wide-spread spam will be virtually impossible.</p>
<p>Below I am going to detail the steps I took to create my Keypair using the command-line gnupg utility. If you are not comfortable with the command-line please check out Thunderbird+Enigmail which will automate the whole process for you and make GPG pretty painless.</p>
<p>For the rest of you that would like to understand what is going on and do it by hand(like me) keep reading.</p>
<p>First fire up a terminal and run "gpg --gen-key". You will be presented with an option of what type of encryption to use.</p>
<p>You should be safe with RSA-2048... but no promises. Our computing capabilities could triple in 3 years rendering 2048 useless. Many say that is impossible, but they said the same thing about RSA-1024. My first key was RSA-1024 and that has since been obsoleted. I erred to the side of caution (read "paranoia") here and chose RSA-4096.Though it may take a while to use when sending large mail... I do not mind considering I will hopefully be able to trust this key for a very long time.</p>

<p>Enter a strong passphrase twice. I do mean STRONG.</p>
<p>Use a mix of numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols. Do NOT write it down anywhere... memorize it. Half of the security of GPG is choosing a password that a robot can not easily generate.</p>

<p>Do exactly that. Beat your keyboard randomly as fast as you can. Move your mouse around. Click and highlight stuff. No I am not kidding. Have fun with it! Let your cat help.

<p>Next is an optional though highly recommended step of embedding a picture of yourself into your key. This is important step because if you get a file signed with someones key and it depicts a Chinese man, and the person you meet later is clearly an American... you might have cause for alarm. This aspect of GPG is very much like a photo ID and it is likewise very important you really do use a real head-shot of yourself, as anything else could potentially invalidate the trust of the key.</p>
<p>Don't worry about how good it looks as you an always change it later with "gpg --edit-key"</p>
<p>You will need to make a 240x288 JPG headshot preferably at 6k or less so your key does not end up huge.</p>

<p>Now your shiny new key-pair is created!</p>
<p>Now, for some damage control.</p>
<p>What if you forget your password? What if every computer and device that contains your private key explodes? What if someone steals your key and tortures your password out of you? What if RSA-4096 is beaten in 10 years?</p>
<p>Crap happens and you need a way to revoke that key in case it does</p>
<p>Generate a "revocation" key file which you can use to revoke and invalidate your key.</p>
<p>Once you generate it, put it on some physical media and store it in a safe place no one has access to but you. Your identity depends on it.</p>

<p>Next we need to make sure the whole world has easy automated access to your public key. Though there is no "offical" server, subkeys.pgp.net is a very important server to get your key on right away. Especially before someone else puts a key on there as you. Subkeys.pgp.net is also a great service because it will in turn migrate your key out to many other partner servers for you.</p>

<p>Finally a last optional step. If you own your own domain, and better yet if your email address is on that domain, you can export your key and upload it to you domain which further verifies you own it. </p>
<p>Putting your key as http://yourdomain.com/0x(your key id).asc is a strong trend I have noticed, and one I will continue with until hopefully it becomes a standard. </p>
<p>I used Rsync to upload my key here. Use whatever you want.</p>

<p>That completes everything you can personally do to in creating a strong trusted GPG identification keyset.</p>
<p>The next, and most important step... is getting other people who believe that you are who you say you are, to sign your key with theirs.</p>
<p>The more verified GPG keyholders that in turn sign your key, the more valid your identity becomes.</p>
<p>Next I will demonstrate the steps you would take to sign a key and by extension the steps someone would take to sign your key. Here I am actually signing my own key as an example which is generally a good idea regardless.</p>
<p>If you actually know me, by all means actually do this for me and I will in exchange sign your key as well.</p>

Are you sure that you want to sign this key with your
key <span class="s2">&quot;Lance Reagan Vick (Personal Key) &lt;lance@reaganvick.com&gt;&quot;</span> <span class="o">(</span>36C8AAA9<span class="o">)</span>

Really sign? <span class="o">(</span>y/N<span class="o">)</span> y

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key <span class="k">for</span>
user: <span class="s2">&quot;Lance Reagan Vick (Personal Key) &lt;lance@reaganvick.com&gt;&quot;</span>
4096-bit RSA key, ID 36C8AAA9, created 2009-05-09

lrvick@baqash ~ <span class="nv">$ </span>gpg --export -a 36C8AAA9 &gt; 0x36C8AAA9.asc

</td></tr></table>

<p>Now you would just need to get the 0x36C8AAA9.asc file you just created to me and I would in turn overwrite my existing one on my domain and upload it to subkeys.pgp.net. Likewise if anyone signs your key and gave it back to you, you would then import that newly signed keyfile and then then re-export it back to to a keyserver as detailed above.</p>
<p>That covers all the hard parts of GPG. From here on out just set up a GPG friendly mail client like Mutt, Evolution, or Thunderbird to sign all your outgoing mail with your new key, and no one can ever easily impersonate or alter mail from you again.</p>
<p>You can also now easily encrypt mail to others who use GPG which means anyone who intercepts the mail gets useless garbage. If you want to test it, send me a random encrypted message.</p>
<p>GPG really is a win win all around.</p>
<p>By all means comment with your experiences!</p>
