    <p>In most cases? Because they are not planned and delegated well.</p>
<p>In order for a web/tech project to be sucessful, particularly in an agency
environment that has lots of clients, employees, and layers of communications,
a strict set of operating proceedures is a fundimental requirement.</p>
<p>Based on my experience working for and with many for any agencies, founding
companies (now on my 4th), and having to take an active role at just about
every stage of many projects... I will attempt to share what I feel to be best
practices to ensure success.</p>
<p>These are all things that if not at least somewhat adhered to, will usually
render the projects that never end, and plummeting company morale. The
following could probably apply to many types of projects, but based on my
experience I can only speak for web/tech projects.</p>
<p>Below I will break the rest of this article into four stages: Introduction,
Definition, Production, and Delivery.</p>
<h3>Introduction Stage</h3>
<p>This is where a prospect is first contacted. Here they are enticed by a
sales agent about how your team can help improve any combination of the their
sales, public exposure, or overall usability of their web/tech offerings.
This is the point where hopefully a prospect becomes engaged and willing to
take the time required to begin planning the project in order to get a quote.</p>
<p>Failure in this stage usually creates a nightmare and loss of money for the
company. Getting prospective client expectations set correctly here is
absolutly critical.</p>
<h4>Tell the truth</h4>
<p>Not knowing team limitations is not an excuse. Sales agents in most cases know
nothing about what really goes into software engineering, and as such
everything is magic to them. If not properly controlled, they will simply tell
a prospect whatever they think they want to hear for easy kudos or comissions.</p>
<p>This works out fine until the work produced by the team does not live up to the
promises made by the sales agent. Sadly however the punishment for this mistake
usually falls on engineering teams who end up having to work insane hours only
to still fail to meet the unrealistic expectations set in the introduction
stage.</p>
<h4>Sell from an engineer-approved list</h4>
<p>Sales agents should only be allowed to sell from a very clear list of defined
possibilities and general services. List and any modifications should only be
considered valid when approved by a senior engineer.</p>
<h4>Don't tell prospects what they want</h4>
<p>Let them tell you. Lots of well crafted questions should be asked here so that
a prospect gets a chance to express things in their company that could be
better, so where applicable they can be directed to solutions your team is
already prepared to offer. If a sales agent simply throws out a bunch of things
prospects will often say "oh yes I want all of that", instead of honing in on
the things they really need and would actually use based on answers to
qualifying questions. Feed them just enough to get them talking about problems,
or less than optimal situations your team might have solutions for.</p>
<h4>Do not discuss schedules</h4>
<p>Discussing even a general timeframe with a prospect, until well into the
definition stage is project suicide. A salesperson should not release any
timeframes that have not been signed off on by engineers, when enough
information exists to do so accuratly. Instead questions like this should be
sought as an opprotunity to encourage a client to invest time in a definition
stage so you can work out the real answers to timeline questions together.</p>
<h3>Definition stage</h3>
<p>At this point a prospect is interested in building out a "blueprint" or
"storybord" of exactly what your company intends to do for them with a
timeframe and quote. If the initial sales stage was done correctly, a prospect
at this point still has no quote, and no timeframe but has been "hooked" and
now wants both.</p>
<h4>Wireframe everything</h4>
<p>At this stage a UX developer should be involved to help work with the client
to iterate over at least functional wireframes that very clearly define every
human-facing aspect of the project. What functions will exist where, examples
of every type of output, what functions will be provided to users vs employees,
etc. A given set of wireframes and overall project plan can not be considered
approved or ready for quoting until it is signed off on by both the client, and
a lead engineer.</p>
<p>If due dilligence is done here quotes can nearly always be provided within 10%
accuracy against the the final outcome.</p>
<h4>Itemize all tasks</h4>
<p>Until a project is broken into very specific tasks and components based on
client-approved wireframes, the design stage is not over. Tasks should be small
enough that they can be defined in hours. Anything that is defined in weeks is
almost certianly made up. You also can also not expect to get an engineering
team to give you an accurate time estimate for a project, until it is broken up
into small functionalities.</p>
<p>This level of detail can also help a prospect see how much is involved in a
given project and increase their overall respect for your team's capabilities
and control of the situation. It will also help them be more understanding when
you tell them how long it will take, and how much it will cost.</p>
<h4>Let engineers estimate hours</h4>
<p>If you are not the one doing the work, then you can't say exactly how long it
will take.</p>
<p>To quote from the FogzBuz article (linked below) "Any system where management
writes a schedule and hands it off to programmers is doomed to fail. Only a
programmer who is going to do the work can figure out what steps they will need
to take to implement that feature"</p>
<h4>Block out testing and documentation time</h4>
<p>If you make the assumption that all software is going to just work on a first
pass, and be easy to understand for any future party that needs to work on it,
you are either a delusional optimist or you have not been around software
engineering very long. If a set block of time is not left for testing and
documentation it will simply not get done, and when it does not get done, it
will come back to bite your company every single time. We are dealing with
humans and computers here. Things will break that are not obvious and things
that seem obvious will not be understood.</p>
<h3>Production Stage</h3>
<p>Now, with all proper planning and client expectation management out ouf the way
it is time to get stuff done.</p>
<p>Here all the hard work and detailed "blueprints" of the project are handed off
fully to the engineering team, to produce.</p>
<p>If the introduction and definition stages were done correctly, this should be a
really fun experience where your engineering team can tackle the well defined
challanges. This will include solving problems that there is existing
experience with in new ways, or getting experience solving new challanges for
the first time.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage you should have a completed well tested work, ready to
hand off to the client in the delivery stage.</p>
<h4>Document everthing</h4>
<p>How do you get this up and running with fresh hardware? What special
considerations exist? How are access credentials made available? What libraries
or third party requirements exist? These are the sorts of questions that a new
engineer walking into this project later is going to be asking. Answers must
exist otherwise that future party that is mucking around in code your team
produced is going to cause more harm than good. Regardless it is going to fall
back on your team as that that future party is going to complain, a lot.</p>
<p>More often than not a future problem that would be a huge ordeal can be avoided
by having easily acessible detailed documentation of everything required to
deploy and use a project.</p>
<h4>Test Everything</h4>
<p>If an end user can do it, then it needs to be tested. If any new
code is pushed, then it must all be tested again. If bugs are not being found
with a new peice of software of any complexity, then testing is probably not
being taken seriously. No software is perfect. If due dilligence is not given
to testing, you are in practice letting your clients or users be your primary
testers. That is amature and reflects badly on your team.</p>
<h4>Don't rely on engineers for testing</h4>
<p>It is a far too common for testing to be written off as the sole responsibilty
of the engineering team. This is a terrible judgement. Engineers should not
be bothered with the bulk of testing. Anyone can do testing, but few can do what
they are doing. Secondly, engineers are the worst people to do testing from an
end-user pespective. They are biased, have tunnel vision, and will often miss
the obvious because their minds are focused on that next big feature to write.
Get the people who are not programming to take the lead in this. Interns,
graphics artists, managers, it does not matter who, but at least 2 different
people with vastly different perspectives need to own this, and be willing to
provide detailed bug reports to engineers with clear written steps required to
reproduce the issue themsleves.</p>
